+ Red Hat System Administration  I (RH124)
	* description
		- The first of two courses covering the core system administration tasks needed to manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers
        - Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) is designed for IT professionals without previous Linux system administration experience. - The course provides students with Linux administration competence by focusing on core administration tasks. This course also provides a foundation for students who plan to become full-time Linux system administrators by introducing key command-line concepts and enterprise-level tools. 

        - This course is the first of a two-course series that takes a computer professional without Linux system administration knowledge to become a fully capable Linux administrator. These concepts are further developed in the follow-on course, Red Hat System Administration II (RH134).
